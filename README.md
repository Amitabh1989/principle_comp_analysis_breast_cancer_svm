Using PCA concept + SVM and Grid Search CV


Principal Component Analysis
Let's discuss PCA! Since this isn't exactly a full machine learning algorithm, but instead an unsupervised learning algorithm, we will just have a lecture on this topic, but no full machine learning project (although we will walk through the cancer set with PCA).

PCA Review Make sure to watch the video lecture and theory presentation for a full overview of PCA! Remember that PCA is just a transformation of your data and attempts to find out what features explain the most variance in your data.
